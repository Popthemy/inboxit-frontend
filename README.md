# Inboxit

**Send messages from any website form without building a backend, configuring SMTP, or writing API logic.**

### The Problem
Most developers waste hours (sometimes days) just to add a simple contact form. They end up setting up backend servers, SMTP servers, email deliverability, rate limiting, and error handling — only for a basic “message received” feature.

### The Solution
Inboxit removes all that friction.

Just add one small script and point your form to our endpoint. Messages land directly in your inbox — no backend, no SMTP setup, no fetch/axios code required on your end.

### Business Value
- **Saves development time**: Go from days to minutes.
- **Reduces complexity**: No server maintenance, no email infrastructure headaches.
- **Improves reliability**: Built-in queuing and error handling so messages don’t get lost.
- **Perfect for**: Landing pages, portfolio sites, SaaS MVPs, event registration forms, and internal tools.

### How It Works (For Developers)
1. Add the Inboxit CDN script to your HTML.
2. Set your form’s `action` attribute to the Inboxit endpoint.
3. Done. Submissions are handled automatically.

No manual fetch calls. No backend code. No configuration.

### Current Features
- Simple form-to-email forwarding
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Clean JSON responses for frontend handling
- Built with Django + DRF (scalable and secure)
- Easy integration with any frontend (React, vanilla JS, etc.)

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Email Handling**: Queued processing for reliability
- **Frontend Integration**: Lightweight CDN script (zero-dependency)

### Live Demo & Integration
[Add your demo link here once the React UI is ready]

Example usage:
```html
<form action="https://inboxit.yourdomain.com/submit/" method="POST">
    <input type="email" name="email" required>
    <textarea name="message" required></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

### Next Steps
I’m currently building a clean React frontend + improved API integration.
